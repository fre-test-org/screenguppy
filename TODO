* auto-detect screen width
    * dumptermcap in screenrc
    * re /:co#([0-9]+):/ in /var/run/screen/S-$USER/.termcap to get cols
* randomize movement
    * maybe?
    * more likely to keep going in the same direction most of the time
* add feeding
    * calling screenguppy with an arg should do it (then can set backtick)
    * need to save state for this, should be one-line text file
    * choose some non-fish places to drop assorted dots: .. . ...
      * brief reverse video splash!
    * when fish mouth passes those dots, remove them
      * this is tricky to detect when speed != 1
    * bind this to a macro with register/process commands
    * unused screen hotkey letters: ejopuy
    * swim faster when there's food ahead?
      * turn towards it immediately?
* add metabolism??
    * fish gets bigger when fed (rate-limit feeding probably?)
    * fish gets smaller gradually over time
    * at a certain point, this merits a turning-around animation
      * don't do this at first though, just flip the whole thing
